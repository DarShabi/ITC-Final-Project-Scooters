# Shared Scooter Image Recognition

### Introduction

The Shared Scooter Image Recognition project aims to develop a solution for shared scooter companies that enhances the user check-out process by automatically analyzing the uploaded images of the scooters. The goal is to determine if the scooter is present in the picture and verify if it is parked properly, ensuring it is not in an inappropriate location such as on the ground or obstructing the road.

#### Features

* Image recognition: The system will utilize computer vision techniques to recognize and identify the presence of a scooter in the uploaded images.
* Parking verification: The solution will analyze the position and surroundings of the scooter in the picture to determine if it is parked correctly or in an unacceptable manner.
